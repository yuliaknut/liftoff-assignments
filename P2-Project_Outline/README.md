## Submission Instructions

### Overview

This app is a mental health tracker that allows the user to make daily notes of their mental state, track specific emotions and their severity, set and modify as needed a mental health agenda and rate their daily progress. 

The user will eventually be able to view their mental health dynamic on a weekly, monthly, all the way up to yearly chart, as well as any past entry. 

The idea for this app originated from exploring the positive impact of journalijng on the human brain.

### Features
* User login - user will be able to create a unique account that will contain their personal info and history.
* Customize account - user will be able to add their own emotions to track to the existing list of most common emotions and set their current mental health agenda. 
* Create entry - user will be able to create new entries when logged in. Every new entry will include a user-written note, prevalent emotion along with its severity rate, self-assessment rate on a scale of 1 to 10, date and time of entry.
* View past entries - user will be able to access and view all of their past entries from a chronologically ordered list. (for now)

### Technologies
* React.js
* Node.js (for now)
* JavaScript

...To be continued...
### What I'll Have to Learn
First, will need to learn React and Node.js, which will likely add to the list of things to learn. Later on, will need to learn to create Trend Lines Charts in React using hidden point system to display user dynamic (which would be a bonus mission).
